abstract = "The literature on spontaneous and stimulus induced human, fetal behaviour is reviewed. Spontaneous fetal behaviours, including body movements, fetal heart rate, coupling of body movements and fetal heart rate, breathing, and the association among behaviours have been characterized. In addition, maturation of behaviours have been described from conception to term. Stimulus induced behaviour, in particular fetal heart rate changes and body movements, have been used to examine sensory and cognitive development. Both spontaneous and stimulus induced behaviour are being employed to assess fetal well-being. Given a rich database, the focus of research is shifting from the characterization of behaviour to the identification and understanding of processes, mechanisms, and experiential factors underlying development."
