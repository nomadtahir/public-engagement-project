1. Convert the baby model from fbx to stl----need to download Autodesk Maya;
2. Make a negative mould based on the baby phantom—external one, PLA;
2.1. Use the reference internal mould (half)– internal one, PVA;
3. Use Ecoflex silicone, pour the silicone inside the mould (with both moulds), once cured, dissolve the internal mould;
4. Pump the baby to have the dynamic effect.
