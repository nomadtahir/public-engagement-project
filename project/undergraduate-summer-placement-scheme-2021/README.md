# Simulator for ultrasound-guidance procedures 
## Description 
The use of ultrasound to identify the anatomy of fetus (head, eyes, heart, lungs, hand, legs, urinary bladder, placenta, etc.) is a common clinical practice due its quickness. However, there are few challenges such as (a) radiating the fetus for long periods which might affect the development of fetus, (b) the little hand-on expertise of clinicians, or (c) the current clinical tools for doing such procedures are far from being available to do a realistic simulation (due to cost, little portability and complex setup). That said, the aim of this six-week project is to integrate and test an open-source simulator using 3D-slicer, plus, ITK, inertial sensors, 3D printing devices and virtual makers. This work will be the starting point for the next stage of the project on usability studies for the simulator.
