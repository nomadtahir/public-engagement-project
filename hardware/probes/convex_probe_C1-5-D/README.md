# Scanned and transformed C1-5-D probe
STL file was exported from a CT scan, then re-shaped in 3D slicer 4.10.2 and detailed in fusion 360 v2.0.8412. 
See the [video tutorial](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AhiABcbe1DBygotebJEY-OcNV2cXPg) of [Tamas Ungi](https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusModelCatalog/issues/5#issuecomment-374652394)
and [#5](https://github.com/gift-surg/us-needle-tracking-verification/issues/5) for detailed journey of the probe design.

## Foot print 
The foot print of the C1-5-D probe is 69.3X17.2mm (Voluson E10 Datasheet). However, dimension measurements are shown below
